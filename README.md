# Job Compensation Prediction System

## Project Description
In today’s competitive job market, both employers and employees need accurate predictions of compensation for different roles.  
This project implements a **machine learning-based predictive system** that can estimate salaries based on various factors, including:

- Job title  
- Location  
- Experience  
- Education  
- Skills  

The system uses a dataset containing job postings along with their corresponding compensation information. Critical features are pre-processed and extracted to improve model performance.

## Machine Learning Models Used
Several machine learning techniques are implemented for building prediction models:

- **Gradient Boosting**  
- **Decision Trees**  
- **Random Forests**  
- **Linear Regression**  

To improve performance and generalization, the following strategies are applied:

- **Cross-validation**  
- **Hyperparameter optimization**  

Model accuracy is evaluated using metrics such as:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- **R-squared (R²)**

## Dataset
- The dataset includes a wide range of job postings with their respective compensation.  
- Pre-processing steps include cleaning, feature extraction, and encoding categorical variables.
